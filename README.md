## Introduction

This project emerged as a result of two problem statements from two different hackathons.

The first problem statement was from [COEP Mindspark '23](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.mind-spark.org/Hackathon/&ved=2ahUKEwjAxtz0752FAxUYk68BHdEpCGIQFnoECA0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw06RdrouLwdsLNUz-ZL5QoM) where we had to

> Create a prototype API in 24 hours capable of processing energy solutions data to generate deep insights that can inform strategy, decision-making, and highlight growth opportunities.

The second problem statement was from [PICT TechFiesta '24](https://techfiesta.pict.edu) which was as follows:

> Rural areas often face challenges in accessing reliable and sustainable energy sources. There's a need for solutions that promote clean and efficient energy usage. Design a solution to optimize energy consumption in villages by implementing smart grids and renewable energy sources. The system should monitor energy usage, predict demand patterns, and integrate solar/wind energy for sustainable power generation.
